Ideas for data generation

intermediate award just final reward at that point.

Final score is intermediate reward plus final score.

Keep track of each the scores and then average them after all data is collected.
Chance of duplicates is very small outside of individual runs.

Store Data:

empty 0
Brick 1
unbreakable Brick 2
coin 3
border (can't pass) 2
cannon muzzle 4
cannon trunk 5
flower pot 6
border/hill can pass 7
princess 8
fire flower 9
mushroom 10
fireball 11
goomba 12
spiky 13

Change the whole system to use BitSetS.

Change the observation functions.
Keep mapwrapper the same.  Then during saving, just have to iterate over it.
Or change everything to BitSet, return bitset during observation.

How to store the data as I collected it:

HashMap BitSet to HashMap ActionWrapper to ArrayList

After runs, find average and return 


Choices:
What features to include.
How to rate fitness.  How to choose 'best' class.
